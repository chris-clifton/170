# Summary

- HTTP is a text-based protocol that is the foundation of the web
- two parties involved in HTTP: client and server
- complete HTTP interaction involves a request which is sent from client to server and response from server to client
- a request is sent to a host and must include a method, path, and host header.  It may also include parameters, additional headers, or a body
- GET is the HTTP method used to retrieve a resource from the server
- a response must include a status.  Headers and body are optional.
- a `200 OK` status means request was successful
- Modern web browsers include debugging tools that allow you to inspect the HTTP activity of the page
