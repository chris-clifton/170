# Telnet Video Notes

- HTTP is a text based protocol and underneath everything that happens, its just a bunch of text being moved between the server and client
- After serving an HTTP request, the server closes the connection (some situations where this is not the case)
- Can see underlying structure of response- looks like headers and raw code
